# Telco-Churn-Prediction

The aim of this study was to create classification models for the churn dataset and to predict whether a customer will churn by creating models and to obtain maximum accuracy score in the established models. The work done is as follows:

1) Churn Data Set read.

2) Some of my views from EDA are; 
* There is no difference in churn ratio for male and female.
* Churn ratio for senior citizens is significantly higher. Company must focus on some specific needs of senior citizens.
* Customers with paperless billing have higher churn ratio! May be the people having their bills deliverd in hard copy(paper)are loyal customers of the company.
* Customers paying bills via Electronic check have higher churn ratio. Company must focus on them and ask them if they are facing any difficulties in paying bills via electronic check or not?
* Customers not having TechSupport from the telecom company have higher churn rate. If company is charging high rates for TechSupport, then they must consider giving some discounts on them so that customers can use the service.

3) During Model Building; Logistic regression,KNN, SVM, CART, Random Forests, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost were used to calculate accuracy score. 
* From accuracy scores of all  models, we can see that Logistic regression outperformed other models with accuracy of 80.25%.
